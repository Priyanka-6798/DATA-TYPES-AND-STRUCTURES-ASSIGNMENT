        "##DATA TYPES AND STRUCTURES ASSIGNMENTS\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What are data structures, and why are they important?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS: Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. They are important because they improve performance of algorithms, and help in solving complex problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS: Mutable data types can be changed after creation (e.g., lists, dictionaries, sets). Immutable data types cannot be changed after creation (e.g., integers, strings, tuples).\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: A list [1, 2, 3] can be modified (mutable), while a tuple (1, 2, 3) cannot (immutable).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS: Lists are mutable (can be modified), use square brackets [], and are generally used for collections of similar items. Tuples are immutable (cannot be modified), use parentheses (), and are often used for heterogeneous data or fixed collections.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Describe how dictionaries store data.\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS: Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs, where each key is unique and maps to a value. They are implemented using hash tables for efficient lookup.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS: Sets are used when you need to store unique elements and perform operations like union, intersection, or difference. They also provide faster membership testing compared to lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS: A string is a sequence of characters, immutable, and typically used for text. A list is a sequence of elements, mutable, and can contain any data type. Strings are indexed like lists but cannot be modified in-place.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS: Tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation. This ensures that the data remains constant and prevents accidental modifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS: A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function. Python dictionaries are implemented using hash tables, allowing for fast key-value lookups.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS: Yes, lists can contain elements of different data types, such as integers, strings.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS:Strings are immutable to ensure security (e.g., preventing modification of strings used as keys in dictionaries), enable optimizations (e.g., string interning), and maintain consistency in behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS: Dictionaries provide faster lookups (O(1) time complexity for key access), allow meaningful key-value associations, and are more efficient for tasks requiring unique keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS: Tuples are preferable when you need an immutable collection, such as storing coordinates (e.g., (x, y)) or days of the week, where the data should not change.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS: Sets automatically remove duplicate values when created or updated, ensuring all elements are unique.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS: For lists, in checks for the presence of a value (O(n) time complexity). For dictionaries, in checks for the presence of a key (O(1) time complexity).\n",
        "\n",
        "15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not.\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS: No, tuples are immutable, so their elements cannot be modified after creation. Attempting to do so will raise an error.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case.\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS: A nested dictionary is a dictionary that contains other dictionaries as values. Example: {\"person\": {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}}. It is useful for representing hierarchical data.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS: Accessing elements in a dictionary has an average time complexity of O(1) due to the use of hash tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS: Lists are preferred when you need an ordered collection of items, allow duplicates, or require indexing by position (e.g., list[0]).\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS: Dictionaries were unordered in Python versions before 3.7. From Python 3.7+, they preserve insertion order, but they are still primarily accessed by keys, not positions.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS: Lists retrieve data by index (position), while dictionaries retrieve data by keys. List access is O(1) for indexing but O(n) for searching, whereas dictionary access is O(1) for keys.\n",
        "\n",
